# 24 V DC relay-operated contactor coil

Open `24v-relay-contactor-control.adigun.json` from the workstation's **Open project file** command.

This is a one-sheet, source-backed wiring example using five verified component instances: one Phoenix Contact PLC interface relay, one Schneider Electric TeSys D contactor, and three Phoenix Contact PT 16 N OG feed-through terminals. It contains 13 orthogonal wire segments and four pin/net groups. The project JSON is validated against the CAD engine's schema; its BOM and wire list are derived from the same component and wire instances.

## Intended circuit

- X1 is the external PLC Q0.0 output boundary and feeds K1 coil A1; K1 coil A2 returns through X3.
- X2 is the external +24 V DC feed to K1 common terminal 11.
- K1 normally-open contact 14 feeds KM1 coil A1; KM1 coil A2 returns through X3.
- X1–X3 are feed-through terminals. Their two connection pins are internally connected in the part model.
- The model shows static relay contacts. It does not simulate relay actuation, prove a PLC output's suitability, or model an upstream 24 V supply.

## Scope and review

This is a control-wiring example, not a complete motor starter or construction package. It intentionally omits mains switching, motor, upstream protection, conductor sizing, panel layout, relay-state simulation and safety coordination. Verify the component variants, supply, external PLC interface and application limits against current manufacturer documentation and qualified engineering review before adapting it.


# Siemens SIRIUS 3RM12 reversing starter

Open `siemens-3rm12-reversing-starter.adigun.json` from the workstation's **Open project file** command. This one-sheet example uses one source-backed Siemens reversing starter and fifteen Phoenix Contact PT 16 N OG feed-through terminals as explicit line-side, motor-side and control/signal boundaries. Its schematic wires connect all fifteen manufacturer-designated 3RM1 pins to those terminal blocks. The CAD model derives the BOM and wire list from those instances and routes.

- Phoenix Contact PT 16 N OG, item 3212144: <https://www.phoenixcontact.com/en-lt/products/feed-through-terminal-block-pt-16-n-og-3212144>

The project records line terminals 1/L1, 3/L2, 5/L3; motor terminals 2/T1, 4/T2, 6/T3; control terminals A1, A2, IN1–IN3; 24 V DC run output OUT; and fault signaling terminals 95, 96, 98. It models wiring only. It does not include a motor or upstream protection, select conductor size, verify application suitability, simulate direction switching/protective trips/signal contacts, or provide a construction package. Siemens rates 3RM1201-1AA04 at 0.1–0.5 A and a maximum motor power of 0.12 kW at 400 V AC; confirm motor/application fit before use. NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION without qualified engineering review.


# Siemens 3RM12 and SEW DRN63MS4 motor

Open `siemens-3rm12-reversing-starter.adigun.json` from **Open project file**. The one-sheet model uses one Siemens SIRIUS 3RM1201-1AA04 starter, one SEW-EURODRIVE DRN63MS4 motor, and thirteen Phoenix Contact PT 16 N OG terminals. It contains 33 orthogonal wire segments, 17 isolated nets, and explicit U1/V1/W1, U2/V2/W2 and PE motor terminals. The U2/V2/W2 star point is wired explicitly; the motor winding ends remain separate from one another.

- Siemens starter catalog: <https://mall.industry.siemens.com/mall/en/en/Catalog/Product/?mlfb=3RM1201-1AA04>

The sourced motor table gives 0.12 kW, 0.405 A, 1380 rpm, 0.83 Nm and power factor 0.64 at 400 V / 50 Hz. Siemens publishes a maximum 0.12 kW motor rating and a 0.1–0.5 A adjustment range. These nameplate/catalog values fit the published rating envelope; this is not a protection coordination, application suitability or construction approval. Motor performance, starter switching, protection, safety and load behavior are not simulated. NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION without application-specific engineering review.


# Siemens SIRIUS 3RV2011-1JA10 motor-protection breaker

The component catalog includes the Siemens SIRIUS 3RV2011-1JA10 as a source-backed three-pole motor-protection breaker with six independent external terminals, line-side 1/L1, 3/L2, 5/L3 and load-side 2/T1, 4/T2, 6/T3. The editable overload setting is optional until an engineer supplies an application-specific value; any entered value is range-checked against the manufacturer's 7–10 A adjustment range.

- Siemens SIRIUS 3RV motor-starter-protector equipment manual: <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/attachments/60279172/manual_SIRIUS_circuit_breaker_3RV_en-US.pdf>

This part is not inserted into the DRN63MS4 motor example: its 7–10 A setting range does not match the motor's documented 0.405 A rated current. The CAD model does not simulate contact state, trip behavior, fault interruption, selection or coordination. Use manufacturer data and qualified application review before selecting protection; NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION.


# Siemens SIRIUS 3RV2011-0FA10 low-current motor-protection breaker

The catalog also includes the SIRIUS 3RV2011-0FA10, a size S00, Class 10, three-pole breaker with the same six externally connectable terminal identities documented for the 3RV2 family: 1/L1, 3/L2, 5/L3 and 2/T1, 4/T2, 6/T3. Its manufacturer-published overload adjustment range is 0.35–0.5 A, its instantaneous magnetic release is 6.5 A, and its published 400 V motor power is 0.12 kW. The SEW DRN63MS4 motor data records 0.405 A and 0.12 kW at 400 V / 50 Hz, so these catalog/nameplate values overlap. This ratings-envelope comparison does not select a setting or establish application suitability, short-circuit coordination, conductor sizing or construction approval.

No combined motor-feeder example is approved yet. Build it as a distinct project after sourcing and verifying the contactor, protection and motor arrangement. The CAD model does not simulate contact state, trip behavior, fault interruption or coordination. NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION without qualified engineering review.
